# Dashboard Connection Issue Solution

## Problem Analysis

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified the main issue with the dashboard not connecting to the backend:

1. **Missing Environment Configuration**: There's no `.env.local` file to define the API base URL
2. **Static Data in Components**: The dashboard components (`overview-cards.tsx` and `analytics-chart.tsx`) are using hardcoded static data instead of fetching from the backend
3. **No React Query Integration**: The dashboard components aren't using React Query to fetch data from the API

## Solution Plan

### 1. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file with the API base URL:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

### 2. Update Dashboard Components
Modify the dashboard components to fetch real data using React Query:

#### Overview Cards Component
- Replace static data with API calls to fetch real statistics
- Use `useQuery` hook from React Query
- Implement loading and error states

#### Analytics Chart Component
- Replace static chart data with API calls to fetch analytics data
- Use `useQuery` hook from React Query
- Implement loading and error states

### 3. API Integration
The `lib/api.ts` file already has the necessary API functions:
- `scheduleAPI.getScheduledPosts()` for upcoming posts
- `scheduleAPI.getHistory()` for published posts
- Need to add functions for analytics data

### 4. Implementation Steps

1. Create `.env.local` file with API configuration
2. Update `components/dashboard/overview-cards.tsx` to fetch real data
3. Update `components/dashboard/analytics-chart.tsx` to fetch real data
4. Add new API functions for analytics data if needed
5. Test the dashboard connection

## Required Mode Switch

To implement these changes, we need to switch to Code mode which can modify the actual source files.
